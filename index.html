                        <p>I'm Howard (Sheng-Hau) Peng, a data-driven product builder currently working as a Data Analyst in the fintech industry in Chicago. My work focuses on owning complex financial systems, transforming manual workflows into scalable, automated platforms, and turning data and AI capabilities into real operational and product impact.</p>
                        <p>I hold a Master's degree in Statistics from the University of Chicago and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from National Taiwan University. My background combines strong foundations in statistics, machine learning, and quantitative finance with hands-on experience in building production-grade data systems and AI-driven solutions.</p>
                        <p>Throughout my career, I have led the design of end-to-end data and AI workflows, automated legacy financial processes, and delivered systems that improved platform stability, reduced operational risk, and unlocked new business capabilities. My experience spans CoreBanking platforms, AI-powered analytics, pricing systems, and customer decision models, where data and models are treated as core product features rather than supporting tools.</p>
                        <p>I am particularly interested in roles at the intersection of AI, product, and complex systems, where machine learning and data are embedded into platforms to drive reliability, scalability, and meaningful business outcomes. If you would like to discuss AI products, data systems, or potential collaborations, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email.</p>
